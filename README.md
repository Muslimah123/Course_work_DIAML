## Installation and Usage
- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. Most of these projects require Python 3.x. Additionally, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to run the notebooks.
  
- **Running the Projects:** 
  - Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
  - Navigate to the project directory of your choice.
  - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb` files) in the directory. You can do this by launching Jupyter Notebook in your browser and navigating to the file, or by opening a terminal, navigating to the project directory, and typing `jupyter notebook` to launch Jupyter Notebook in that directory.
  - Run the cells in the Jupyter Notebook to see the code in action. You can modify and rerun cells to experiment with the code.

- **Dependencies:** Some projects may require additional Python libraries. These dependencies can typically be installed using pip. For example, to install a library like Pandas, you would use the command `pip install pandas` in your terminal.

- **Note:** These projects were developed as part of academic coursework. They are intended for educational purposes and may require specific datasets or environments to run correctly.
